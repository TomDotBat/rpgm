# RPGM - A Garry's Mod Roleplay Gamemode Base (Unfinished)
This project was my attempt at rewriting DarkRP in a more generalised, clean and object oriented way. It's got most of the basics done, but if you look at the [issues tab](https://github.com/TomDotBat/rpgm/issues) you'll see there's much more to be done to get it into a complete state.

## Note
In the gamemode's current state, map data isn't provided by the server in any way. You need to download the map data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomDotBat/rpgm/master/map_complete.json) and place it in your game's data folder (garrysmod/data/rpgm/map_dumps/map_complete.json). If you fail to do this, expect the gamemode to spam errors repeatedly as the minimap depends on it.
