# RPGM - A Garry's Mod Roleplay Gamemode Base (Unfinished)
This project was my attempt at rewriting DarkRP in a more generalised, clean and object oriented way. It's got most of the basics done, but if you look at the [issues tab](https://github.com/TomDotBat/rpgm/issues) you'll see there's much more to be done to get it into a complete state.
